Question: A cleaning company produces two sanitizer sprays. One spray kills 50% of germs, and another spray kills 25% of germs. However, 5% of the germs they kill are the same ones. What percentage of germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together?
Answer: After the first spray kills 50% of germs, there will be 100 - 50 = <subtract>(100, 50)=50% left. The second spray kills 25%, but 5% have already been killed by the 50% spray, so it kills 25 - 5 = <subtract>(25, 5)=20%. After the second spray kills 20% of the remaining germs, there will be 50 - 20 = <subtract>(50, 20)=30% left. #### 30
