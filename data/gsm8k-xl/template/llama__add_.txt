Question: Voldemort had his dinner and ate a piece of cake that has 110 calories. He also ate 1 pack of chips that contained 310 calories and drank a 500 ml bottle of coke that has 215 calories. His caloric intake for breakfast and lunch is 560 and 780 calories, respectively. If he has a 2500 calorie intake limit per day, how many calories can he still take?
